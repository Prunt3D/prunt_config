"Prunt","null","null","Enabled","Boolean","False","If set, allow Prunt to start."
"Stepper","Stepper","null","Enabled","Boolean","False","If set, enable outputs to the stepper and allows it to be used for motion. A stepper that is not enabled will never output any signals. On some boards the outputs may be high impedance in this state."
,,,"Invert_Direction","Boolean","False","If set, invert the direction signal output."
,,,"Enabled_On_High","Boolean","False","If set, set the enable pin to high to enable the stepper."
,,,"Fault_On_High","Boolean","False","If set, high reading on fault pin indicates that the stepper is in fault state."
,,,"Mm_Per_Step","Length","Length’Last / 2.0","The distance moved by the stepper for each transition of the step signal. Note that this is the distance for each transition, not the distance for each complete cycle. For stepper drivers that only step on either the rising or falling edge, take the average value for each transition (mm per cycle / 2). Note that Prunt will always output steps in groups of two in the default configuration, so direction signals will always be output on the same step signal state."

,,,"Step_Time","Time","0.0 * s","Time between any step transitions on this stepper. These limits will be enforced even if the commanded feedrate is faster, resulting in a discontinuity in acceleration if the limits are reached. The limits are also enforced if the step generator needs to catch up in case the step generation task is interrupted or is overloaded."
